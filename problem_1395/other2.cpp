/*
Because n is small (only 200), an O(n^3) algorithm is ok. But it is easy to optimize the algorithm to O(n^2). For each rating[j], the number of triplets satisfying i<j<k and rating[i]<rating[j]<rating[k] is cnt(i<j, rating[i]<rating[j]) * cnt(j<k, rating[j]<rating[k]), and the number of triplets satisfying i<j<k and rating[i]>rating[j]>rating[k] is cnt(i<j, rating[i]>rating[j]) * cnt(j<k, rating[j]>rating[k]).
