/*
Intuition
For a given efficiency, we pick all workers with the same or better efficiency. If the number of workers is greater than k, we pick k fastest workers.

Algorigthm
Sort workers based on their efficiency. Starting from the most efficient worker, compute and track the maximum performance. We can use a running sum to track all workers' speed.

When the amount of available workers exceeds k, remove the 'slowest' worker from sum. To do that, we can use a min heap.
