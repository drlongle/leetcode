1. Intuition

When driving past a gas station, let's remember the amount of fuel it contained. We don't need to decide yet whether to fuel up here or not - for example, there could be a bigger gas station up ahead that we would rather refuel at.

When we run out of fuel before reaching the next station, we'll retroactively fuel up: greedily choosing the largest gas stations first.

This is guaranteed to succeed because we drive the largest distance possible before each refueling stop, and therefore have the largest choice of gas stations to (retroactively) stop at.

2. Algorithm

pq ("priority queue") will be a max-heap of the capacity of each gas station we've driven by. We'll also keep track of tank, our current fuel.

When we reach a station but have negative fuel (ie. we needed to have refueled at some point in the past), we will add the capacities of the largest gas stations we've driven by until the fuel is non-negative.

If at any point this process fails (that is, no more gas stations), then the task is impossible.
