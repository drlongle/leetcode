/*
Let's try to think about this problem with an example. Say our input string is [si, si+1, si+2, si+3, .........., sj]

Think of the last character sj. This character either would have been printed fresh in a new turn of printer starting at index j,
OR it might have been printed as a part of some previous turn of printer starting at index < j and >= i.

If we consider the first option then one of the possible solutions would be -
PossibleSolution[i][j] = Solution[i][j-1] + 1

A clear optimization here would be that if sj-1 == sj or si == sj, then Solution[i][j] = Solution[i][j-1].

Another optimization here would be that if si+1 == si, then Solution[i][j] = Solution[i+1][j].

For the second option, suppose there are some characters which are equal to sj with index k < j. Therefore,
our character sj could have been printed as a part of printing any of these characters. So for all such index k

PossibleSolution[i][j] = Solution[i][k-1] (solution to print the string starting at index i and ending at k-1) + Solution[k, j-1]
(solution to print the string starting at index k and ending at j-1)

Note - We don't consider index j on the right side since we are already assuming that it is getting printed as part of
printing the character sk. Therefore it is already covered in Solution[k][j-1]

Our final Solution[i][j] would be the minimum of all PossibleSolution[i][j] above.
