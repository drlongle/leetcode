/*
Compute hashes for increasing prefix and suffix, reusing the previously computed hashes. This is similar to the Karpâ€“Rabin algorithm.

For the string of i size, the hash is: s[0] * 26 ^ i + s[1] * 26 ^ (i -1) + ... + s[i - 1] * 26.

For the prefix hash, we will multiply the previous value by 26 and add a new letter.
For the suffix hash, we add a new letter multiplied by 26 ^ i.
Note that we need to use some large prime as a modulo to avoid overflow errors, e.g. 10 ^ 9 + 7.

Beware of collisions. After you find a matching hash, you need to check the string. Since OJ test cases do not cause collisions, I am not doing it here.
