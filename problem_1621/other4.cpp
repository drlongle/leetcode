/*
Suppose we want to solve the problem for n points and k line segments. Then, we can break it into following
subproblems:

* Don't choose the current point as the end point (i.e Don't make a line segment).
  Then we are left with n-1 points and k segments.
* Choose the current point as the left-end of the line segment (i.e we are going to construct a line segment).
  Now, we have multiple choices for the length of the current line segment (because left-end point is fixed,
  we can change right-end point to get different length segments).
So, now we have to solve the following subproblems:
n-1 points and k-1 segments
n-2 points and k-1 segments
n-3 points and k-1 segments
....
2 points and k-1 segments

The initial solution I implemented did the part (2) using a for loop. This solution would pass only 62/68
test cases. Now, we can optimize it further by observing that there is lot of repetitive work being done in
the for-loop for (2).
Take this example:
[(n,k) means solution of n points and k segments]
(6,3) reduces to (5,2) + (4,2) + (3,2) + (2,2). [This is only step 2]
(5,3) reduces to (4,2) + (3,2) + (2,2). [Again, this is only step 2]

So, now optimizing the for-loop is just another DP problem (a rather simple one)
